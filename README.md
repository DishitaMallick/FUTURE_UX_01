PawCare – Pet Care Service UI/UX Design (Figma)

PawCare is a UI/UX design project developed in Figma for a pet care service platform that assists pet owners in browsing pet care services and scheduling appointments with ease. The project aims to design a friendly, trustworthy, and intuitive user experience through effective layouts, visual hierarchyand interactions.

Project Overview
The purpose of this project was to design a clean and intuitive interface that makes it easy for pet owners to browse pet care services and schedule appointments.

Homepage Features
The homepage is intended to make a great first impression with the use of attractive pet images and a value proposition. The homepage features a simple navigation bar for easy access to primary actions, showcases top services with distinctive cards, and establishes trust with customer testimonials featuring ratings. A nearby map for pet parents further emphasizes local presence and authenticity, with ratings and booking data further enhancing user trust.

Services Page Features
The services page features all the available pet services in an organized and easy-to-view layout. Each service is showcased as a separate card with an image and name, making it easy for visitors to identify and remember services such as pet boarding, grooming and spa, day care, dog walking and playtime, and vet visit assistance. When a visitor hovers over a service card, the background color shifts, and a short description pops up, allowing visitors to learn about the service without having to click through. A prominent “Book Now” button encourages visitors to move ahead with the booking process.

Book Appointment Page Features
The book appointment page is created to facilitate the process of booking an appointment quickly and easily. It has a formatted page that enables users to choose a service, provide personal information, select a preferred date and time, and provide additional information if needed. The use of icons is done in a way that enhances usability. The service selection dropdown opens as an overlay, which dims the background to keep the focus, and closes automatically when the user clicks outside. A progress bar is used to reassure the user, while the submit button directs the user to complete the booking process.

Contact Us Page Features
The contact page is created to enable users to contact the system for support or inquiries. The page has input fields for name, phone number, and email, as well as a message section where users can communicate in detail. The use of icons enhances usability, while the visible “Send Message” button encourages users to send their messages. Contact information such as location, phone number, email, and working hours is provided at the bottom of the page, which provides users with multiple options to get in touch with the service.
